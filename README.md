# Cplusplus-Program

# Summarize the project and what problem it was solving.
I created this project to Build an item tracking program for corner grocer which included all of the requested functionality. This program that I built included C++ and python.

# What did you do particularly well?
I did very well with making sure that my program for the project functioned well. I made sure that all of the requested functionality was displayed in a manner that was going to be easy for a user to understand and also for the user to be able to easily use.

# Where could you enhance your code? How would these improvements make your code more efficient, secure, and so on?
I could have enhanced my code by making sure that it was user interface friendly. Meaning that the series of screens or pages and visual elements would be able to interact in a way that was pleasing to the eye for the users that will be utilizing my program.

# Which pieces of the code did you find most challenging to write, and how did you overcome this? What tools or resources are you adding to your support network?
The part of my code that was challenging for me to write was the C++ portion C++ It’s a language do I find a tad bit difficult to write I am more comfortable with python therefore the coding portion for C++ was challenging for me.

# What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects or course work?
The main skill that I acquired from this project that will be transferable to other projects that I’m going to work on in the future is going to be merging C++ and python. It was great that I built a 2 in 1 coded work. I am looking forward to merging different languages together in the future.

# How did you make this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
I made this program maintainable, readable and adaptable by allowing it to take user input. I also include several lines of comments for it to be understandable and readable.
